# Warhammer 40000 rules clarification

## Core Rules

### Visibility

When is a unit visible from another model?

[Shooting Phase > Select Targets](https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Select-Targets):

> Only enemy units can be chosen as the target for an attack. In order to target an enemy unit, at least one model in that unit must be within range (i.e. within the distance of the Range characteristic) of the weapon being used and be visible to the shooting model. If unsure, get a look from behind the firing model to see if any part of the target is visible. For the purposes of determining visibility, a model can see through other models in its unit. [...]


## Advanced Rules

### Ruin transition

What models can go into and move through ruins?

As per [Common Terrain Features > Ruins](https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k9ed/the-rules/advanced-rules/#Ruins), ruins have the following terrain traits:

- Scaleable
- Breachable
- Light Cover
- Defensible
- Obscuring

Only the scaleable and breachable traits are relevant to answer this question. First [Breachable](https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k9ed/the-rules/advanced-rules/#Breachable):

> INFANTRY, BEASTS and SWARM units can move through the walls, girders, chains and foliage of this terrain feature without impediment.

So while infantry, beasts and swarm units can move through said terrain features, other models can still move into ruins that have large enough gaps in their walls. They just can't go through walls etc.

[Scaleable](https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k9ed/the-rules/advanced-rules/#Scaleable) has two definitions, one that applies to Obstacles and one that applies to Area Terrain. As ruins are categorized as Area Terrain, let's look at this definition only:

> Only INFANTRY, BEASTS and SWARM models, and models that can FLY, can be set up or end a move on the upper floors of an Area Terrain feature with this trait (other models can be set up or end a move on the ground floor). INFANTRY, BEASTS and SWARM models can move through the floors, ceilings, and gantries of this terrain feature without impediment.

So this rule describes how to move vertically through terrain features such as floors in order to get up. While models other than infantry, beasts and swarm can still move through ruins if there are large enough gaps, only defined unit types can additionally go up or on top of them.

Supportive arguments from [Goonhammer's Guide to Terrain in 9th Breachable chapter](https://www.goonhammer.com/ruleshammmer-guide-to-terrain-in-9th/#Breachable):

> Also worth noting is that if this trait is given to a Wood then unless the Vehicle or Monster can FLY, or there is sufficient space between the trees of the wood for the vehicle to fit between them, they can’t actually move through the Wood terrain feature. It’s not actually 100% clear in the rules what a FLY model that ends it move half way through a tree is handled, though most I think would resolve it using wobbly model if there’s a place the model could balance on top of the wood’s canopy.

And from [the Scaleable chapter](https://www.goonhammer.com/ruleshammmer-guide-to-terrain-in-9th/#Scaleable):

> It’s easy to consider this the vertical movement barrier (floors) equivalent of Breachable’s horizontal movement barriers (walls). Splitting them into two traits does allow players to address the Industrial Structure in a way that I’m surprised GW didn’t suggest with their examples.

### Duration of markerlights

How long does a markerlight stay on an enemy model?

From the [Markerlights](https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k9ed/factions/t-au-empire/#Markerlights) chapter:

> When a unit is hit by a markerlight, place a counter next to it for the remainder of the phase.
